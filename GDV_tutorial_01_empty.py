# TODO first step is to import the opencv module which is called 'cv2'

# TODO check the opencv version

# TODO load an image with image reading modes using 'imread'
# cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED  - If set, return the loaded image as is (with alpha
#                         channel, otherwise it gets cropped). Ignore EXIF
#                         orientation.
# cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE  - If set, always convert image to the single channel
#                         grayscale image (codec internal conversion).
# cv2.IMREAD_COLOR      - If set, always convert image to the 3 channel BGR
#                         color image.


# TODO resize image with 'resize'

# TODO rotate image (but keep it rectangular) with 'rotate'

# TODO save image with 'imwrite'

# TODO show the image with 'imshow'
