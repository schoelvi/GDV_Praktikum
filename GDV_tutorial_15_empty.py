# TODO Define a function that detects and draws corners into the image
    # drawing helper variables

    # get a different color array for each of the features/corners

    # show the resulting image


# TODO define the callback function
    # read paremeters from slider positions

    # cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack returns corners as floating point values,
    # hence convert to integer

# TODO create a greyscale image for the corner detection


# TODO create a window with sliders and show resulting image

# TODO create sliders for all parameters and one callback function

# wait until a key is pressed and end the application
